# From: https://dev.to/joeattardi/how-to-publish-an-npm-package-to-npm-and-github-package-registry-simultaneously-using-github-actions-213a
#
# Tag the commit
#    git tag 2.0.1
# Then I push this tag:
#   git push origin 2.0.1
#
# This will draft a new release in the repository, but it won't run the workflow yet.
# Go to your GitHub repository page and navigate to the releases section.
# You'll see the tag you just pushed at the top of the list.
#
# Click on the tag, then click the "Edit tag" button. Enter some details about the release,
# then click the green "Publish release" button. Once the release is published, the package
# publishing workflow should begin. To verify this, go to the "Actions" tab of your repository.
# You should see the "Node.js Package" workflow running.
